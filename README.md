# Program_Automator
This project aims at automating various parts of a code syntax which is tedious due to repetitions.

Program_Automator makes life easier by typing the usual syntax of a programming language in your text editor or IDE by itself, so that you can focus on the logic of the program rather than wasting time on the usual syntax. As of now, the program works for sublime text on windows machine but you can change the path of sublime text in the program so that it works on linux too. Please read README.md for more information :)

It will be soon converted to a desktop app :)

## Requirements:

- Python 3 (3.6.8 preferable)
- pyautogui (pip install pyautogui)

## Steps to RUN:

- Provide path of sublime text in automator.py line 94
- Provide path of folder where your files tobe saved in automator.py line 34
- Run automator.py and enjoy! :)

## Future Scope:

- Can be used to automate other codes which are most often used
- Can be used to teach a computer to assemble various codes together
